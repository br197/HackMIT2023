IDEAS:

Burst the bubble
a. User writes thoughts which will be processed by sentiment analysis using transformers package. If the thought is negative, the thought becomes a bubble that the user can burst. If the thought is positive then it can be something permanent (a gold trophy or something). 

b. Technology: Transformers, a hugging face package 

Talk to me
a. User can speak/text the ai and the ai can speak/text back to make the interaction conversational. This way the user can relieve their stresses and anxieties with the ai and the ai can suggest some CBT (Cognitive Behavior Therapy) strategies to help the user.

b. Technology: NLP (using transformers maybe)
